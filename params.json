You'll need to register an OAuth Application in your Campaign Monitor account to get a Client ID and Client Secret to use with this OmniAuth strategy.\r\n\r\n[travis]: http://travis-ci.org/campaignmonitor/omniauth-createsend\r\n[gemnasium]: https://gemnasium.com/campaignmonitor/omniauth-createsend\r\n[gembadge]: http://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-createsend\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nAdd a dependency in your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'omniauth-createsend'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `bundle install`.\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuse OmniAuth::Builder do\r\n  provider \"createsend\", ENV['CREATESEND_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['CREATESEND_CLIENT_SECRET'], :scope => 'ViewReports,CreateCampaigns,SendCampaigns'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gem also includes an [example](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/omniauth-createsend/tree/master/example) Rack application which demonstrates how to authenticate with the Campaign Monitor API using this OmniAuth strategy.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n1. Fork the repository\r\n2. Make your changes, including tests for your changes.\r\n3.
